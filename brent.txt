a ball of fuzz almost bill went back
a big surprise he lasted weeks which was
a final destination and i half 
a golden christ drags a club foot
a hole duct taped for years
a pewter flask some woman sitting on his lap
a place where men piddle
a spring storm flung a limb in
a thing he could repair
a thing to disassemble and diagnose
about begging to fix a window 
against his right side swirls in front and behind
against the water his shirt sticking to his chest
also meant chocolate bunnies
an impossible orange moon
an orderly burning of fuel and air
and against the mud sticking to his feet kicks 
and as the hours pass it grows
and dashed to the den
and exhales sphinx moths
and i see it whole again
and kicks through the constraint of soaked jeans 
and maybe one of the girls or the boys
and on the eastern wall jesus limps toward calvary
and the naked torso spotted 
and they hadn't money for chemo
and when the drive kicked off
and senses buzzing she breaks
and—two bubbles conjoined—
around the block to listen to it purr
as a burnt marshmallow he didn't
as did sharla thompson's laughter when
as earth rolls over in its sleep
as garth from wayne's world said
as i drive the five hours home 
as if in a sci-fi fantasy
as if the cross weren't enough
as it broke in my mouth
as long as he can work
asleep on the back seat
at eight o'clock on a friday night
before my nephews dyed them
begging for mercy ieds erupt boys fall in slow-mo
beneath the calls of birds a placid drone 
beneath the hood of a crown vic
between cylinders and pistons
bill quit going years ago
bill was no deacon was never there
burst over the bridge while his father swigged 
but as garth from wayne's world said
but esther green raised a stink
but the color of eggshells
but the pastor took esther's side
but watching it now i recall
by midnight the moon is tiny
cars aren't like people
children asleep in the next room
cilantro on the altar a sacrifice
cleaning spark plugs and gaskets
closes back around his left i am a scab 
clutch or busted fuel pump—fix it
cold stares at the edge 
come winter--dawn and dusk--
compressed inside a shiny wrist-sized capsule
confound and bewilder me women
crawls over the horizon
cut beside a swamp
dad kept stored in the attic
did she like me no yes how to
didn't laugh except at my jokes
down past the donut shop then 
dressing their knotted limbs
drifting up into the sky
enthralled of a woman in love
even just sitting smoking his camels 
every year of me in a clip-on tie
expect to see a sign moon 36 miles
feeling for cracks
floating through the plaque clogging it up
floyd unlaces his boots he wades in up to his knees
follow me in to help with lunch
for a few minutes it appears
from communion this morning  
from over at cotton creek he urges them 
from the albuquerque airport 
from the levee he'd heard the low roar 
from the refinery will say a few words
full of knocks and pings
furled among bald cypress
gets friendly waves and
given the right tools fixing things
goes under and kicks kicks hard and pulls 
gun noises something like kill-kill-kill-kill
have to be at the home in jefferson city
he breaks the surface and sucks in great gulps of air
he gave him against all the bottles he's ever emptied 
he is risen indeed
he is risen to which we said
he knows patti hated
he says we could get brother spencer 
he showed a picture of a cancer cell—
he swims through the tug's wake till he collapses 
he thinks you can find the failing
he'd ask how the sermon was 
he'd still have himself a sabbath 
he'll drive the sheriff's squad car 
he's in the garage bent 
his dead perverted father and the shoddy heart
his outrageous ultimatums gets sniped but swipes
his patience would wear like oil 
his stick sword across the neck of a hostage
his waist leans in to the current it presses 
how he would pick apart a problem
how she woke us every easter
how they'll burn in the bath tonight
hunters tramp the muddy bogs 
i am driving to the moon
i am the essence of freshness
i could hold on my tongue
i fear change it is the specter
i noticed the red flecks on the whisker-tips 
i read her my poem stung amber smith
i remember clearly
i should have called my mother
if people would up their giving
in a hole in the backyard
in a swath of highway 
in all the films i've seen of vietnam
in harmony amid the stained-glass hues
in his faded flannel and blue jeans handsome
in hot oil spreading itself
in search of ducks or other signs
in the belts and hoses
in the corner of the stained glass
in the donut shop parking lot
in the empty lot on the corner an ideal battlefield
in the end is the durable mystery
in the gaudy plastic baskets
in the kitchen with the tall bottle
in the picture bible i had as a child
in the river's skin he thinks he pitches forward
interpret the simile of a girl's smile
interpret the simile a woman's smile
into baghdad's hidden basements combustion
into motion some jaunty bounce
is still a riddle i'm older wiser
it looked like a softball in his lung
it sits like the heavy orange stone
it was one of those sunday lunches when 
it's more the steady thrum of machine gun fire
i'd pictured tiny explosive blasts like bombs
keeps pulling and kicking kicks across the current
kept in motion by its nearness
kicks against patti who's left him and against 
knees bent arms raised the dance
knowing the resurrection of christ
last night in boise
leaving a jagged absence 
like a sphinx's rubik's cube you
like a tenor poetry my vehicle for desire
like flour and cardboard mixed
like the box fan patti had always run 
like the pantheon on olympus
like wisps of smoke from a censer
listen like she was an engine 
listens to the frantic pounding of his heart
living in smyrna for still living
loft pine cones empty their clips shout
looked like the prickly sweetgum balls 
make love to their wives with
mason buxton has idled at the stop sign
maybe it's the garlic
maybe later after the owls' game
maybe sometimes we get it
mince words just as bill asked
moss like gray lace
my sister in some ridiculous hat
my wife's white-socked feet
new hope baptist church smyrna louisiana
no one gave a red cent for jesus's gold foot
not long after the deacons dismissed 
of a child who has not learned
of bourbon he'd raced his charger
of carrot tomato spinach
of his mustache—he'd choked it back
of life a stranger passing through
of our taste buds
of pine cones backs scratched by well-aimed throws
of sorts—i'd come home to him sitting outside
of town a green metal sign
of tugs pushing barges upriver swims hard 
on his way home from work it's war again
on the muddy bank glistening and exhausted
on the opposite wall at sunset
on the refinery's night shift
on your way again cause effect
once the girls were grown
one fourth of july they watched fireworks 
or else the cilantro's scent
or fallen angels in the lake of fire
or of the year at my aunt's
or replace and you'll be
or simply a cratered satellite
our bodies make a single swaying temple
over the base of the wok
overhead a flat white wafer
past a barge heaped with scrap metal he was wrong
pine cone hand grenades cypress knee ieds
plodding across the dark desert of sky
polish the gray vinyl tile of our kitchen
pulls me into her movements
pulls through the underwater rumble 
read her my pen sang amber smith
real damage like the night before 
reports their latest failure the pulpit empty 
right by accident and what's left
rising lifting the glass lid till it rattles
said it wasn't worth the trouble
said so at the good friday service
seemed—some thought—the shadow of death
sharla thompson's laughter when
she left smyrna floyd flipped
she spins from fridge to stove
she stays the knife under my hand
she's found in the crisper
shining like an oiled wound
slimmed with two days' waning
smaller but brighter not orange
sprayed through the streets of tikrit or ad-dawr
sticky with late summer sap every day for a week
still riddles older but not wiser
still the chairman of the deacons rises
suppose martha will do some flowers
sure ain't having it at the church
sweat under orange hard hats
talk up a game of cards or settle
tenor or poetic vehicle my desire
that cling to his legs kicks himself for still 
that confounds and bewilders me women
that fall in our yard only softer
that hums with mosquitos 
that kept me awake at night
that sealed the tomb of christ
that too kept me awake at night
the holy spirit squeezed inside a chapel
the bulbous roiling fiery clouds of napalm
the deacons planned a repair drive
the deacons wished him well
the host's dry starchiness
the kind of friction that will do 
the kitchen table supper plates and all
the next month the patch on the window 
the pastor when bill green passed 
the pianist plays a hymn
the precise missiles that rode laser wires
the pungent onion the ginger singed
the river is an artery he a tiny white blood cell 
the river is black he drifts on his back 
the sun once washed bright gold 
the syncopated strain of ammunition
the tumor and the rest was likely black 
the velvety white skin of a neck rubbed blood red
their neckties and comb-over haircuts
they all will die eventually the swordsman barking
they count their wounds hands pocked with imprints
they don't laugh except at your jokes
things are fine which is why 
this choir of fragrance chanting praise
this easter night with my wife
this is how it happens every time they all know
through a white undergarment 
through that foot as it does now 
to be looked down upon by deacons
to fear of a priestess
to help her sleep his father had brought him here 
to let her know we landed
to mason buxton's or buster henry's
to pock earth's face crater fields of battle
to pray about it they bow their heads
to put on slacks his good white shirt 
to rest at the end of the road
to the parish line to buy but first 
to the planetary body i call home
to the tiny tongue-throned gods
to work the next day which was not
tonight the pastor search committee 
two easters ago cash for the glass
until his chest burns and head throbs and finally 
until they all lie still suck in lungfuls of air
wafting its message i am green
was all he knew to do she'd cry
was like a sphinx's rubik's cube you
we fear change it is the specter
welcome riddled with lead shot
whatever progeny of earth and seed
when her husband bill was dying 
when we found live rabbits
where are the photos she took
where boys split themselves into troops and terrorists
where jesus's left foot should be
where pistons pump to beat the engine's drum
while i stand at the cutting board
while rice simmers on the back burner
white bubbles pressed together
who did she like me no yes how to 
who knows how long the doctor said 
who later will convene in a kiss
will have ended in defeat he'll head over
windows down he can hear them yelling where they fell
with interstellar highways
with power to sever limbs and scatter shrapnel
with slivers of red glass
with the salt from a drop of sweat—
women want you to come after them
women want you to come after them
yet it seems weightless
you change your life
you must change your life said 






august
loster and loster

frank didn't know where the bus was taking him but he didn't know that he didn't know with the fruits of his errands in each hand he had followed a gaggle of teenagers and two silver-haired women onto the 429 that was the bus he had ridden from the campus of wuhan polytechnic college out on the edge of the city's sprawl to the believe your new life shopping center and it was the bus that would take him back to navigate the narrow aisle frank had turned his body and sidestepped toward the back of the bus trying not to jostle passengers with his things in one fist by a handle the salesgirl had fashioned from twine he carried a new dvd player in its glossy cardboard box the other fist clutched plastic sacks of various translucent colors one sack held a frying pan and an assortment of kitchen utensils another new towels and dishrags a third bulged with pirated dvds in clear plastic slipcovers frank would be all set up for his new life in wuhan and the wad of red 100 rmb notes in his billfold felt only a little thinner than before
curious stares like cameras panning after him followed frank's crabwalk down the aisle to where he stopped near the rear door every seat was filled several passengers stood in the aisle clinging to the handgrips that dangled above their shoulders the doors whooshed shut and the bus lurched forward frank steadied himself against a pole and set his items at his feet around him flowed streams of language that struck his ears as harsh and cacophonous but exhilaratingly authentic not the spitfire dialogue in subtitled kung fu movies or the ching-chong chimes his brother david joked about against frank's meek complaints of poor taste real mandarin or even better perhaps it was the local dialect wuhan-hua
frank smiled politely at the two silver-haired ladies who had taken seats to his right the women smiled back at him and then chuckled and he could only wonder why standing to frank's left a teenaged boy peered up at him from under the bill of a cap the cap bore the chicago bulls logo and the misspelled phrase 3-pert nba champins in embroidered script when frank looked at him the boy didn't avert his gaze or speak or even smile he seemed to be studying frank and the scrutiny made frank shift his weight from foot to foot and suck in his stomach a little he took out a handkerchief and wiped beads of sweat from his forehead the guidebook had warned about pickpockets and thieves in train stations and on crowded buses frank moved his billfold from the rear pocket of his blue jean shorts to one in front and he kept his hand there beside it he felt the business card mr hu had given him so to contact me in the case of emergencies he looked down to keep an eye on his purchases then glanced up just long enough to see the boy still watching him he was smallish and wiry he looked thirteen maybe fourteen years old probably quick as a cat just innocent-looking enough to avoid suspicion big-city pickpocket rings always used kids like this even in the us—frank saw a hidden-camera expos on dateline once

later recalling how the old women chuckled at him it would be their tea-stained teeth that frank remembered most vividly but there was no malice in it—it seemed to him a gentle and knowing laugh as if they somehow knew he was lost or was about to be
 in wuhan bungles like this would become as common as cow patties in a pasture to use a phrase of his brother's frank would see himself in time as a connoisseur of error his expertise finely calibrated by breadth and depth of experience he would learn to distinguish the slip from the goof the blunder from the blooper the flub from the faux pas the simple mistake from the serious miscalculation he'd commit worse missteps too the kind to make him wonder what type of person would do such things who he was becoming in this place where he seemed to lose himself again and again 
but this first mistake was not like that the first was a mere blunder the simple act of boarding the wrong bus and not even the wrong bus exactly the right bus—the 429—but going the wrong direction not a novice-expat-in-china mistake but a country-bumpkin-come-to-town mistake there was an unwritten rule common sense really ingrained in any city slicker worth his public transit pass to go back where you came from cross to the bus stop on the opposite side of the street this frank failed to do 
so blame it on a lifetime spent in shallowater cruising his pickup over the potholed streets and wide farm roads and the one highway that connected the town to anywhere else blame it on texas where even in the big cities public transportation was nothing but a line item targeted for cuts in the municipal budget taxpayer largesse serving to shuffle the junkies and day laborers from the shelters downtown to the social security administration or the job placement office or the va blame it on the euphoria frank felt being so far from home so far from emily and the humiliation of her infidelity or on the giddy thrill of discovering just how far a united states dollar could stretch in this country blame it on the curious settledness of his stomach frank hadn't felt such digestive health on a consistent basis in months and he experienced it as a pleasant but distracting change like a sudden silence after hours of dull and grating noise blame it—perhaps most immediately—on the overconfidence borne of frank's shopping success on his first outing alone in wuhan
whatever the final cause frank was oblivious to his error in this state of happy ignorance he bounced along with the bus glancing every so often at the ladies with the silver hair and the curiously discolored teeth

the boy in the bulls cap had finally looked away so frank permitted himself to take his eyes off his goods and look around vibrations from the engine and the road sent small tremors up frank's legs and he made a game of loosening his grip on the pole and trying to keep his balance as the bus swerved and bumped along 
he had never ridden a public bus back in the states but he liked it you learn more about where you are when you don't have to watch where you're going he thought that sounded nice maybe he would write it down in his journal when he got back he revised the line a few times rearranging the word order reversing the syntax he restated it in negative terms if you're only looking where you're going you won't know where you are no better the first way a nugget of wisdom the kind of thing he would have passed on to his juniors at shallowater high he would definitely write it down his new students at the college might appreciate it once classes finally began it sounded almost like a chinese proverb they probably liked that sort of thing

while frank turned the aphorism over in his mind the bus made several stops at each one the bus got more crowded more passengers climbing on than off and each time frank picked up his purchases and scooted a little farther down the aisle goaded by the advancing bill of the 3-pert cap eventually he and his things were wedged up against everyone else and he could only stand between the knees of a sleepy man sitting on the back row frank squeezed the dvd player between his heels there was no pole or handle to hang onto but frank didn't need one anyway he'd been absorbed into a mass of bodies that would have held a passed-out wino upright frank could not have watched where he was going if he wanted to and as to learning about where he was the main thing he seemed to be learning was that it was hot hotter than a fresh-fucked fox david would say but only if he had three or four beers in him and the fish weren't biting 
the bus didn't have air conditioning and when they stopped at red lights there was no breeze to cut the sizzling august heat frank dabbed his handkerchief at his forehead again and mopped the back of his neck he'd read somewhere that wuhan was one of china's four furnace cities now he believed it a cloud of body odors like the sweaty aura of a locker room prompted him to breathe through his mouth rather than his nose and he tried to focus on the sights outside the window scores of bicyclists glided perilously close to one another bells tinkling in their wakes the bus passed a square where vendors and cooks were setting up tables and stools for the night market a shirtless old man shuffled down the sidewalk with a bamboo pole across his shoulders hanging from each end was a cage full of live chickens—live chickens the novelty of it all was almost enough to distract frank from the heat

at the next stop a flood of people emptied the bus the old ladies with tea-stained teeth clung to the handrail as they stepped down frank took their seats piling his sacks beside him sitting made him realize how much his legs ached he'd been walking and standing all afternoon the boy in the cap sat down in front of frank and frank was glad to have the delinquent squarely in view he lay a protective arm on top of his bags finally the doors closed and the bus resumed motion the wind coming through the open window cooled frank's face 
the bus followed a rightward curve and soon the engine roared in protest against the steep grade of a hill with the bus mostly empty frank could see through the windshield over 3-pert's shoulder they were approaching a bridge when the bus crested the hill the view of the city suddenly broadened they were crossing the yangtze frank opened his window as wide as it would go and stuck his head out for a better look from this height even the nondescript apartment blocks and traffic-choked avenues took on a scenic air an immense pagoda yellow crane tower frank's guidebook told him stood high on a hill overlooking the water below with the needle of a tv tower rising from the smog on the opposite side ferries dawdled their way across the river from the levee on the far bank children were flying kites and beyond the parti-colored kites a street parallel to the river was lined by a row of ornately columned colonial-era buildings 
the river bestowed on wuhan a sense of beauty and mystery that had been lacking in frank's mind it was night when he had crossed it coming from the airport a few days before under the cover of darkness the yangtze had been pretty but unimpressive just a dappled mirror of city lights in the afternoon sun its span looked stately its dark waters animated by a powerful current seeing it now somehow confirmed for frank that coming here had been the right thing to do that he was right to leave shallowater that he wasn't as crazy for coming to china as everybody thought 
david for one had discouraged his leaving said there were better ways to cope there was therapy he'd said support groups frank was just running away from his problems simple escapism frank didn't care to defend himself shallowater had become a prison escape was exactly what he needed watching the eddies stirring the surface of the river he knew david was wrong no therapy could have wrought this change in him not this quickly frank was reminded of a song david's daughters sang i've got peace like a river i've got peace like a river i've got peace like a river in my soul

frank and david went fishing on the first saturday of june each year their way of celebrating both david's birthday and the start of frank's summer frank was not the angler his older brother was frank liked catching fish except there was so much fishing involved but he enjoyed the liberties they allowed themselves on the lake namely beer and in their mother's phrase the vulgar tongue and it was always good to get out of shallowater for a while especially this year 
on the drive down after small talk about work and weather frank had told david his plan he'd found a website promising jobs teaching english in china and frank had already scanned his college diploma e-mailed it in with a resum and the requisite photo and applied for a passport
 there's therapy you know david said later after they'd launched the boat and motored to a good fishing hole he said it casually like therapy was a quick errand between the grocery store and the bank might not hurt to stop in for some counseling david reeled in his spinnerbait waiting for something to strike his hands relaxed but ready maybe some kind of divorce support group
we're not divorced said frank he muttered this through one corner of his mouth as he was holding the end of an empty fishing line between his lips and leaning over to open the tackle box at his feet besides that'd just give'em something else to talk about he selected a silver and blue lure with two treble hooks dangling from its underside then took the line from his lips with his free hand poor frank gilman he said in mock pity fuck that 
yeah david said fuck that shit hard 
david got a little giddy when he cussed and frank couldn't tell if he was sympathizing or teasing him or maybe just enjoying the feel of those foreign words in his mouth frank threaded the lure onto his line tied a knot and bit through the extra length with his incisors then he reeled up the slack and cast the bait out into the glistening water it made a pleasant splunk did you know he asked somebody put me on the prayer list
david laughed of course he knew he was a deacon and a sunday school teacher and their father had pastored the church for decades before he died of a stroke not much at the church escaped his notice tell you what though he said talking bout moving to china—hell a few people praying might do you good they were communists after all it'd been barely a decade since they were shooting students in tiananmen square and weren't they cracking down on their own people again followers of that cult—karma something
dharma qi frank corrected he'd seen the news reports too but he didn't admit to david how it gave him pause
david reeled in his spinner and opened the lid of the cooler beer he offered frank nodded and david chucked him a can listen frank he said you gotta man up david popped the tab on his own can then tipped it back and swallowed running away ain't gonna make this better hear me 
frank reeled in his line steadily pausing every few cranks to give his lure a slight twitch finally he stopped and turned toward his brother i'm not the one running away 
no shame in talking to somebody david said quietly as though his voice might frighten a fish
i talk to you frank took a pull from his beer
hasn't done much good far as i can see david made a perfect cast dropping his spinnerbait right inside the edge of a layer of duckweed floating on the surface of the water you're plumb crazy
in normal circumstances frank weighed david's advice carefully but these were not normal circumstances frank's life had been torture since emily's leaving that was right after christmas she'd had the forethought not to spoil the holiday for their families breakfast with his and dinner with hers a choice so calculated it still left frank stunned then the day after new year's she and her new flame came to pack up her things and it turned out her new flame wasn't so new 
frank had seen emily only once in the months since then though she was living just fifteen miles away on the west side of lubbock in her absence he slept on the couch with the tv droning ate microwave dinners burgers picked up from the drive-thru stopped going to church stopped going out at all if he could avoid it except to visit his mother on sunday afternoons on saturdays when he could stand being alone no longer he would show up unannounced at his brother's house and sulk at the dinner table while david leslie and their two girls ate occasionally frank would eat too but mostly he just sat brooding over the meal like a thunderhead
now with the sunlight glancing off the lake the tip of david's pole suddenly dipped he leapt to his feet and cranked the reel frank loved watching his brother like this—at his most focused his most alive david adjusted the drag on his reel letting the fish carry the line out a ways before reeling some more he followed the fish around the boat giving some line and then reeling it back in repeating this action with a graceful blend of efficiency and patience within a few minutes he had worn the fish down and brought it alongside the boat frank scooped the dip net down into the murky water and up came the biggest bass he had ever seen 
gonna have it mounted he asked
david hooked two fingers inside the fish's gills and removed the barb from its lip the fish's tail curled to one side then the other its mouth opening and closing as though in mute echo of frank's question without answering david knelt down lowered the bass into the water and came up shaking the lake from his hands

when frank got home that night before even showering off the odor of lake water and fish he logged on to his computer the dial-up modem chirped beeped and crackled then a cheerful digitized voice announced that he had mail he clicked his inbox and on the screen glowed a response to his application an offer a position as foreign english expert at wuhan polytechnic college wuhan he had never heard of it and the title sounded strangely utilitarian—almost orwellian but also inflated somehow not teacher or instructor of english but expert and foreign—that word capturing the substance of the decision before him whether to trade the familiar for the alien the known for the new but new was what he needed after only a moment's hesitation he clicked reply and accepted better not to give david another chance to talk him out of it 
the next day when frank told him he'd taken the job david just shook his head and repeated his assessment crazy then a question frank had already considered what about mom
she won't know the difference that was true—most sundays when frank visited the nursing home their mother didn't even recognize him they spent the hour playing go fish his mother delighted that a kind stranger had shown up to play cards
that's not the point david said
in august though it was david who lifted frank's two suitcases into the back of his gmc and drove him to the airport in lubbock frank's nieces rode in the back seat of the truck and sang along to a cd of children's songs they had insisted against frank's wishes on coming along to say goodbye in his peripheral vision frank saw david glance over at him as if he might say something but frank turned away and looked out the window at the fields of cotton passing them by every farm looked the same a windbreak of cedars wrapped around the house and barn another lining the long gravel driveway the long metal arms of the pivoting irrigation system row after row of leafy stalks here and there white fibers beginning to peek from the bolls
at the airport frank insisted they drop him off rather than park and accompany him inside and this time his nieces' pleas to the contrary were overruled frank hugged the girls while david unloaded the two suitcases from the bed of the pickup
take care of yourself david said holding out his palm 
frank took it they didn't really shake hands—no pumping up and down like eager salesmen—but just squeezed their palms together in a kind of manual hug frank noticed the strength in his brother's grip his hand dry and rough calloused with years of work i'll get by just fine he said
that's what i'm afraid of david said before finally letting go

head hung out the wide bus window the wind ruffling his hair as he gazed down at the majestic yangtze frank felt the best he had in months ever since that december day it was as if a black hole had settled somewhere in his bowels its mass compounding as time went on something had settled in his bowels or at least had unsettled his bowels for their movements would begin with little warning and their contents would be eliminated with a shocking urgency
during the spring term frank had used all but eight of the sick days he had accumulated during his eleven years at shs his students theorized about his frequent absences with an impressive array of hypotheses some of them showing a creative spark frank could only wish for in their essays and poems he couldn't get out of bed suicidally depressed a brain tumor was causing migraines sexually frustrated he was visiting prostitutes in lubbock he spent mornings knocking on the doors of every apartment complex in a twenty-mile radius determined to find his wife and talk her into coming home the truth was frank feared he'd soil himself if he left the house his doctor referred him to a specialist who gave a diagnosis—irritable bowel syndrome probably triggered by stress—and free samples of fiber supplements and sent frank on his way
since arriving in china though he'd had none of his jaw-clenching stomach cramps and he was regular as the mail as his father used to say it felt good to feel good 
but as the bus passed over the bridge and picked up speed on its descent frank's face suddenly blanched if he was crossing the river he was headed the wrong way they were passing from the university district of wuchang on the southeast side of the river into hankou the business and government district to the north for reasons frank could not have explained even if he'd had time to think about it crossing the river struck him with a fear that crossing the pacific had not he stood abruptly almost falling back into the seat as the bus jounced along and rounded the curve of an exit ramp coming off the bridge 
let me off he yelled to the driver who just glanced in his mirror 
frank made for the door no longer caring who he jostled with his shopping bags a cramp seized his stomach endless minutes passed as he waited for the bus to come to a halt frank inhaled a deep breath and let it out slowly 
when the bus stopped he told himself he would only have to cross the street and wait for a 429 headed the other way easy as pie

finally the bus's brakes screeched the doors whooshed open frank jumped down and when the 429 was gone he hurried across the street there he found a bus stop but no one waiting to board frank ran his fingers over the sign scanning the list of numbers there it was smack in the middle 429 he rapped a knuckle against the sign and exhaled with relief maybe the stomach cramps would stop now frank plopped down on the bench and set his bags and dvd player at his feet had he managed to grab everything in his rush yes it all seemed to be accounted for the kitchen things the towels the dvds no thieves on the bus then no real harm done frank would board the first 429 that came and make it home in due time
he took out his phrasebook to practice his mandarin several buses arrived in the next fifteen minutes but no 429 as each one stopped all its passengers emptied out gawked at the foreigner mumbling mispronounced phrases to himself and shuffled off down the sidewalk then each bus pulled off down a long driveway to a sort of depot where it turned around or occasionally sat vacant while the driver hopped out to smoke the newly empty buses circled around and then turned back toward the heart of hankou none continued on toward the bridge on toward wuchang instead they retreated from the river as if there were no bridge at all
frank lowered his phrasebook as the sixth of these buses he was counting yi er san si wu liu chugged back the way it had come on the sidewalk across the street a figure caught his eye the boy in the bulls cap he was squatting on his heels arms crossed over his knees watching frank just as he'd done on the bus the boy did not avert his eyes he just stared his blank expression made frank's chest flutter but he offered the boy a little half-wave a recognition that he remembered him from the bus the boy did not wave back instead he stood and crossed the street in frank's direction the thought passed through frank's mind that if the boy did try to steal his dvd player—and who would bother with the other things—he wouldn't have a clue how to alert the police or explain to anyone what had happened unless they spoke english frank picked up his bags and placed them safely on either side of him tucking them under his arms like chicks under their mother's wings the boy—who was probably older than he looked frank now guessed and quite possibly malicious—did not sit on the bench or approach frank but there he was not even twenty feet away hovering in frank's peripheral vision
another cramp clenched frank's stomach he didn't want to miss the next 429 but when it came it would be an hour's ride before he reached the college he needed a bathroom before then a glance at his surroundings revealed no public wc where else a convenience store a restaurant a bank maybe he flipped to the survival chinese page in his phrasebook he rehearsed for a couple minutes until with no 429 in sight he got up and schlepped his things down the sidewalk past the boy in the 3-pert cap the boy's eyes trailed after him as he went

when frank returned to the bus stop buses continued arriving every few minutes turning around at the depot and retreating from the yangtze back into the wide streets of hankou which were growing more congested as the afternoon wore on toward evening the 972 came the 715 the 326 another 972 no 429 frank kept counting the buses in mandarin yi er san    more buses unloading passengers still no other passengers waiting to board frank would have liked someone else to be waiting there even if he couldn't communicate with them he rubbed his hands on his thighs blinked away the sweat dripping into his eyes 
twenty minutes had passed since his dash to the toilet if a 429 had come while he was doing his business surely another was due to arrive by now frank stood up and checked the sign again there it was 326 429 715 972 of course there were also dozens of indecipherable pictographs staring back at him in neat little columns no doubt holding the key to the mystery of how to get back across the river he had been obliged to leave his handkerchief in the bathroom wastebasket so now frank wiped the sweat from his temples on the short sleeves of his tee-shirt large sweat marks were blooming under his armpits and he understood perfectly why the shopkeeper at the dvd stall had rolled up his shirttail to uncover his belly another 715 arrived then another 326 one by one passengers disappeared into the side streets and alleyways after stepping off the buses frank wished he'd brought a water bottle he could easily find a shop selling bottled water he was sure but only at the risk of missing the 429 he sat down again and crossed his arms and he couldn't stop his legs from bouncing up and down another 972 pulled up in front of him then just behind it a turquoise-colored taxi pulled to the curb and a woman climbed out
this was frank's chance he scrambled to gather up his things lest someone else lay claim to the cab in the back seat he fished a business card out of his pocket it had been given to him by mr hu the college's foreign affairs officer and it bore the name and address of the college in chinese characters on one side and english on the other the driver held it delicately in his hands studying it for a moment by this time frank had leaned back in his seat relaxing in the certainty that he was on his way home but rather than put the car in drive and take off the driver handed the card back to frank explaining in a loud voice something that frank would have very much liked to understand frank's reply was equally loud and equally incomprehensible to its listener he and the driver both rephrased and repeated themselves speaking slowly and with precise nearly oratorical articulation with the same results the subsequent exchange of gestures however a flurry of pointing and hand-waving and head-shaking communicated with crystalline clarity first frank's intention to cross the bridge into wuchang and second the driver's refusal to do so the gestures—pointing hand-waving head-shaking—were repeated to ensure both parties understood one another perfectly they did 
frank slouched against the seat then pressed the front of his shirttail to his sweaty face the damp spots that appeared there looked like a rorschach test and for a moment frank imagined himself in some therapist's office what do you see a river a pagoda a woman's face a bridge bewilderment anger despair he got out of the car and trudged back to the bus stop bench it was clear that the driver wouldn't take him where he wanted to go though the reason was no more apparent to frank than why there had been no toilet paper in the bathroom stall or why the boy in the bulls cap had stared at him so intently or when precisely he had lost emily's good faith
sitting there with his bags the buses making their loop and the bicycles whizzing by the sounds of the yangtze just out of earshot but still there as a ghostly presence in frank's mind frank was overtaken by a violent desire for emily's company for the weight of her body on the bench beside him an ache opened within him like a sinkhole and the giddy self-confidence he'd felt earlier drained into it emily's face appeared in his mind pale green eyes and tight brown curls a small scar on her left cheek where she'd been burned as a toddler his stomach tightened his jaw flexed he felt he might vomit the image of emily widened like a camera zooming out in his brain and she was naked her soft pale hips rolling above a male figure frank stood up and paced he sat down he couldn't strike the image from his mind her breasts bounced as she arched her back straddling some asshole professor from lubbock frank wished she were here with him and he hated himself for wishing it he wanted to kick something to punch something he wanted to throw something and scream he reached into one of his shopping bags and gripped the handle of the saucepan thinking he might strike the bus stop sign with it his stomach heaved he wanted to slap emily again and again as hard as he could and he wanted to kiss her eyelids he wanted to feel her smooth hands on his bare back he wanted the damn bus to come where the hell was the 429 how would he get back to the college how had he been so oblivious he had boarded the bus on the wrong side of the street she had been fucking that professor for two fucking years

at least one rumor spread by frank's students was not entirely false imaginative though it had been frank had in fact knocked on doors at two lubbock apartment complexes in search of emily upon reflection he would come to understand this search to be the product of a particularly complex blend of error one part misinformation two parts misjudgment and a pinch of utter delusion in early march frank called in sick and drove to lubbock first thing in the morning that's when emily was most likely to be at home she worked night shifts at the university hospital and watched the today show over a bowl of cereal before going to bed if frank got there by eight or nine she would probably still be awake and if he could only talk to her—after all she hadn't moved in with the guy there was still hope this was the pinch of delusion
with the morning sun cutting through air that held a warmish cruel pretense of spring frank knocked lightly on the door of number 201 at quail ridge apartments a congregation of low-pitched green structures at the intersection of 82nd and quaker this was the address emily's cousin had reported to david but when a man with a thick gray mustache and a rather halting command of english finally came to the door his appearance presaged by the yapping of a short-haired poodle frank thought maybe emily's cousin had meant 102 or 101 or maybe 202 or 210 or 120 frank found emily at none of these mostly his knocks went unanswered the tenants likely at work at school when he went back to the old man with the poodle and described emily to him the man shook his head 
frank walked down the steps and searched the parking lot for emily's camry which is when he noticed the name of the complex on the opposite side of 82nd street quail run had david really given quail ridge as the name of emily's complex or had frank misremembered but his luck at quail run was no better no sign of the car no answers to his ringing of doorbells though frank was sure he'd seen one or two peepholes darken with peering eyes and when frank asked at the office the property manager refused to confirm or deny the identity of any residents uncompelled by frank's claim to be emily's husband of eleven years or by the presentation of his driver's license to prove they shared a last name 
mr gilman the woman said in a voice sweet as cough syrup if your wife don't live with you—and here she paused for effect chewing her gum—and she ain't told you where she's at—another pause—she probably don't want to be found
frank left the office he was about to give up and cross the street back to quail ridge where his truck was parked when emily's champagne-colored camry rolled around the corner going a bit faster than customary or safe in a parking lot frank jumped out in front of it and emily's tires screeched her front bumper came to a stop inches from frank's shins 
emily frank scuttled to the driver's side where emily was slowly cranking the window down indistinct twangs of country music floated out hey he said whatever words he'd rehearsed on the drive down from shallowater had fled his mind at the sight of the car emily had changed out of her scrubs and she was smoking a cigarette her hair was down the curls falling just shy of her shoulders you don't smoke he said   
what are you doing here frank she said you ought to be at the school she brought the cigarette to her lips then puffed out a long thin wisp of smoke that lingered below the sagging upholstery of the camry's ceiling before it dissipated she reached down and shut off the radio
words finally came to frank not the exact ones he'd practiced in his head but close enough he missed her he loved her whatever the problem was they could work it out he forgave her for cheating on him it wasn't too late
i know you're hurting frank she said with her free hand she tucked a strand of hair behind one ear revealing a dangly gold earring an appurtenance frank knew for a fact he'd never seen her wear before and which called to mind the dimpled blade of a spinnerbait i do and i'm sorry for that
where are you going he asked the earring shimmered and gleamed taunting frank it was not emily's style too big too showy and she didn't wear jewelry to work anyway and wouldn't she just be going to bed soon 
breakfast
i'll come with you frank said please we could just talk for a while
i have to go frank emily opened the ashtray and stubbed out her cigarette the tray was on the verge of overflowing a rat's nest of ashes and cigarette butts he's expecting me to be there already

now with no sign of the 429 in sight frank leapt up from the bench and raced down the sidewalk his shopping bags swung as he walked bumping against the sides of his knees he paid no mind to where he was going jaywalking across intersections turning corners pedestrians looked on with alarm as he wove between them but he avoided their stares and kept walking if a clump of people blocked the path in front of him he crossed the street if at an intersection traffic kept him from crossing in one direction he crossed the other twice he nearly collided with bicycles their little bells jingling frantically 
finally he slowed out of breath he still felt as if he might throw up and he began to dry heave a shop close by had a chest of cold drinks outside it and he bought a bottle of water he drank in large gulps then spit out a mouthful of water into the street he bought another bottle and drank it more slowly his breathing slowed became more regular he tried to gather his bearings the shop was some kind of mini-grocery or convenience store chests of drinks and ice cream bars outside boxes of fruit displayed on a table a few shelves stretching back into poorly lit recesses on a glass countertop facing the street was a red telephone the kind mr hu the foreign affairs officer had told him about a pay phone his bags on the ground at his feet frank took mr hu's business card from his pocket and he motioned to the shopkeeper that he wanted to make a call he paid the man and the shopkeeper dialed the number for him
frank pressed the receiver to his ear and the phone began to ring turning his back to the counter he watched a thin woman sitting on a tiny wooden stool shining shoes her back facing him the receiver emitted several rings frank's heart racing through the silences between them come on mr hu he muttered the shoe-shine woman turned and looked at him her mouth agape her teeth stained and crooked finally an operator's recording came on the line a polite feminine voice delivering a message that was clear as could be in a language frank did not know he slammed the receiver into its cradle and cursed loudly the shopkeeper shot him a stern look frank put his elbows on the counter and held his sweat-drenched head in his hands pressing the heels of his palms against his eyes in little circles the motion making spots of light dance behind his eyelids
is there some trouble a voice asked
when frank opened his eyes standing beside him was the boy in the bulls cap he wore a white tee-shirt and brown pants rolled up to his knees his face bore the same dull stare he'd aimed at frank on the bus and when frank was sitting at the bus stop you speak english frank said
a little the boy introduced himself as xiao gao and he asked again what frank's trouble was 
the question hung in the air for a moment like a fishing lure sailing at the end of its line finally frank spoke i don't know where i am his own voice sounded pathetic to him trembling and weak-throated but maybe the boy could help 
who do you want to call xiao gao asked
frank handed him mr hu's card it occurred to frank that xiao gao had been following him since the moment he stepped off the bus—that he had trailed him on his dash to the restaurant and back to the bus stop that he had seen frank's false start with the taxi that he had witnessed his nervous standing and sitting and pacing and bouncing that somehow he had zig-zagged through the crowded streets after frank until he came to a stop outside this tiny storefront if the boy were a thief wouldn't he have tried to take something by now but xiao gao paid no attention to the shopping bags and frank decided the boy had no designs on his dvd player he was absorbed instead in reading the business card which he kept turning from the chinese to the english side
do you have money xiao gao asked without looking up from the card in his hands
why this question about money frank edged away taking a half step back he tried to read the boy's face but it was as illegible to him as the characters on the sign at the bus stop  why were you following me 
xiao gao raised his head looked into frank's eyes he seemed to be searching for his words you were becoming loster and loster he said his voice soft but clear
it's not my fault frank snapped it's the damned bus the 429
unfazed by frank's sharpness xiao gao again asked if he had money
for what
to pay the taxi driver
i tried frank said but you already know that
come with me said xiao gao
together they walked out to the street and xiao gao flagged a taxi he opened the passenger door and showed the driver the business card they haggled back and forth in mandarin the taxi driver gesticulating in what frank vaguely felt was the direction of the river finally xiao gao turned to frank give him fifty yuan now xiao gao said then pay this price—he gestured toward the taxi's meter the glowing red zeros waiting to climb—when you get to there
so it was as simple as that a matter of knowing the right words to say the right questions to ask knowing what to offer in order to get what you wanted and how to offer it frank suddenly saw the great breadth of his unknowingness wide as a west texas sky so much he hadn't known so much he didn't know now but frank was grateful for now to be found to be helped on his way he fished the money out of his pocket then he piled his things in the back seat and climbed beside them before closing the door he turned to xiao gao and thanked him
it doesn't matter xiao gao replied 
frank waved goodbye as the taxi merged into the flow of traffic he took another sip of water and gazed at the city passing outside the bikes and cars and shops and faces streaming by he reached up to rub the tense muscles in his shoulders as they drove his stomach settled some he would be home soon—his new home the college not until he was crossing the yangtze headed back to wuchang and watching the glittering gold flakes of late afternoon sun on the water did he realize that as xiao gao had waved back at him smiling from under the bill of his cap the boy still held mr hu's card in his hand clutching it like a talisman to his chest
end






cold front

in the kitchen delong's aunt was beating eggs in a bowl as she squawked her pointless gossip to his mother who stood at the stove and pretended to pay attention her sun-weathered face glistening despite the chill in the air meanwhile the five men—if his slow-witted cousin was a man then delong would count himself one too—sat around the table on stools eating dinner his uncle and cousin had been staring at frank laoshi since they'd come in from the fields and sat down barely peeling their eyes from him to look at the food they shoveled in their mouths they had remarked on his height and on the strange paleness of his blue eyes
doesn't he own a coat jianjun the cousin had asked his front teeth hanging over his bottom lip like those of an ass
he's american you idiot said delong's uncle he's rich of course he owns a coat
delong relished his uncle's rebuke of jianjun his cousin had embarrassed him this morning in the fields and uncle's words soothed his ego a bit even jianjun's own father thought he was stupid
he left his coat in wuhan delong explained that's why he's wearing baba's wuhan's sultry summer had seemed unwilling to end yielding instead to a subtle decrescendo so the weather was still quite warm when the two of them departed and the front that came through overnight caught frank laoshi by surprise delong loaned him a sweater and his father insisted their guest take his coat never mind the difference in their sizes there was a comic faintly delicate look to frank laoshi's bare wrists poking out of the sleeves
if frank laoshi knew he was the subject of all this foolish chatter he gave no sign and delong didn't bother to translate it seemed his teacher rather than eating was busy maintaining the appearance of eating frank laoshi had tasted the cold dish of greens—was there an english name for jiucai—and was hesitantly eyeing the three fatty squares of hongshao rou in his otherwise empty rice bowl then obscured by the din of cooking and talk came the high-pitched chime that signaled the rice in the cooker was done at the sound of the hollow ding frank laoshi looked up his eyebrows hopeful little arcs 
can i just have a little rice daniel he asked his voice sounding dry and uncharacteristically quiet i'm not that hungry
it felt odd to be called by his english name here in his own home wondering if his father remembered the word rice delong took a piece of the braised pork belly from the dish in the center of the table shook off a couple drops of the russet-colored sauce and thrust it into his mouth the tender meat seemed to melt on his tongue and the sauce was a subtle balance between savory and sweet this at least had turned out perfectly usually the first week of october was one of delong's favorite times of the year a few days off from school for national day his first home-cooked meals since the summer card games with his mother and father every night he had thought inviting frank laoshi home with him would make this holiday especially memorable it certainly was turning out to be that but for all the wrong reasons frank laoshi glancing pleadingly at the rice cooker once again seemed oblivious to his own ill manners 
when delong's mother had served the hongshao rou his father had reached across the table and with a few flicks of his wrist dropped three chunks of the pork into frank laoshi's bowl a courteous host serving his foreign guest who was clearly unskilled with chopsticks frank laoshi had said xie xie mr zhang but he just poked at the hunks of meat to be fair delong thought he was probably telling the truth about not being hungry delong's parents had served him snacks all afternoon—slices of cantaloupe roasted chestnuts peeled sticks of sugar cane to chew even a coke his father sent delong into town to buy knowing americans were fond of the fizzy drink now frank laoshi's request for rice hung in the air like a cloud of warm breath on a cold morning 
what did he say 
delong could tell his father was beginning to weary of the constant need for translation although it had been but twenty-four hours since they had arrived he asked for a spoon he told him their native dialect so seldom practiced since delong had left for college felt as strange on his tongue as the lie 
wife called delong's uncle a spoon for the foreigner 
the gas burner in the kitchen was hissing and the sizzle of food in hot oil alternated with the scraping of a spatula against the wok sizzle-scrape sizzle-scrape sizzle-scrape-scrape in a moment delong's aunt appeared with a spoon she laid it on the table by frank laoshi and laughed nervously unsure whether to speak to him he smiled at her dumbly sizzle-scrape meanwhile the pieces of pork still rested untouched in the teacher's bowl delong explained to him that customarily rice is served at the end of the meal after the main dishes but if you prefer—
fanqie chao dan delong's mother interrupted placing a steaming dish of scrambled egg and tomato on the table then retreating to the kitchen frank laoshi's eyes lit up and he skewered a piece of tomato on the tips of his chopsticks—here apparently was a dish familiar to him
tell him to taste the pork delong's father said his eyebrows hung low over his dark eyes as frank laoshi took a bite of egg and tomato he should eat meat 
yes he's so thin delong's uncle agreed his arms look like a chicken's legs
my father invites you to try the pork frank laoshi delong noticed the fingers of his father's free hand curling and uncurling as though flexing stiff joints the way they often did when his anger was brewing 
the pork frank laoshi swallowed his food and looked down at his bowl delong caught the expression on his teacher's face though he tried to stifle it a fleeting involuntary wrinkle of the nose like he'd caught a whiff of air from a latrine delong hoped his father didn't notice 
as national day had approached the visit from an american teacher became a point of great pride between delong's father and his uncle and between the zhangs and the other villagers a reminder to all that their son would not face a life in the fields like the dullard jianjun that with their years of sacrifice and discipline driving him he had risen to the heights of a scholar that they would have a comfortable life in their old age because of delong he understood these sentiments without a word of them being spoken they were what urged him on in his studies perpetually 
and he knew his parents had gone to considerable trouble and expense to make frank laoshi's stay comfortable they were by no means wealthy—just ordinary farmers—and there was as much meat in the hongshao rou as they consumed in a typical week it was one of delong's favorite dishes reserved in his family for special occasions what was it frank laoshi found unappetizing about it the thick chewy skin or the succulent fat on its underside foreigners of some religions did not consume pork at all delong knew but frank laoshi was christian not jewish or muslim was it the dark pool of soy sauce and vinegar perhaps or maybe the oil beading its surface what had caused that wrinkling of his teacher's nose
frank laoshi had composed himself and he smiled at mr zhang in america we have a saying he said save the best for last'
delong again translated for his baba faithfully this time his father's fingers were working like a squid's tentacles the gesture was worrisome delong's mother was capable of flying into a livid rage but it passed quickly it was lightning dazzling but short-lived his father's wrath on the other hand was a raincloud in a valley it gathered itself gradually then soaked you to the bone for days threatening to sweep you away in a flood 
delong's father snatched up a piece of pork and sucked it into his mouth he spoke softly but firmly in china we have the best first and eat rice last
it means nothing baba delong said as if this were just about a mealforeigners have different ways from chinese let him have rice 
tell him
americans eat their rice first jianjun asked
my father says delong told frank laoshi eating meat first is good for the digestion 
silence hovered over the dinner table interrupted only by the smacking sounds of delong's uncle and cousin eating and by the clank of the plates and bowls when delong's mother set another dish down on the table 
frank laoshi looked at delong then at mr zhang then he looked down at his bowl he repositioned the chopsticks in his hands but still he held them awkwardly his fingers hooked like talons clutching at twigs those claws that bare thin wrist poking out of baba's coatsleeve the leg of one of the hens outside in the lane just as uncle had said frank laoshi reached into his bowl the tips of his chopsticks crossed and the cube of pork splashed back down in its puddle of sauce he tried again carefully and gained a purchase he hunched down over his bowl held so precariously and drawn so slowly toward frank laoshi's open mouth the meat seemed to float in the chilly air to hover toward his pale and sunken face before slipping from between the chopsticks and tumbling to the floor

delong was destined to be a scholar from the time he was one month old his nai nai his father's mother prayed and burned incense at her little ancestral shrine for months from the time that first one daughter-in-law became pregnant then the other the babies would come due just two months apart and the government was strictly enforcing its new one-child policy the occasion was momentous each of her sons would have their one and only child when the first baby was born—given the name jianjun meaning building the army upon reaching his first month—she knelt at the shrine and burned paper money in thanks that the child was a boy when the second child also turned out to be a boy she marveled at the family's good fortune first two sons and now two grandsons
nai nai had always favored the younger of her two boys delong's father and because of this she was apt to be more harsh with him more protective and wary lest he get into trouble unlike his elder brother he showed great interest in stories and letters as a child but he had the ill fortune to come of age in a time when book learning was suspect when reading too much or too widely was a mark of bourgeois aspirations that was all past now the cultural revolution had come and gone china was opening up to the outside world and now that her baby was a father himself she wanted to do something special she insisted on spending a portion of her meager savings to purchase a taimao bi an ink brush made from the infant's hair one month after the baby's birth his head was shaved his hair sent to a brush maker in suizhou city and his name decided delong thriving virtue a name worthy of a scholar
how many times had nai nai told delong this story he was no great scholar he knew but she had been a constant encouragement as he progressed from the village primary school to the no 3 middle school on the edge of xihe the nearest town you're not so smart yet she would say if he grew lax about his lessons or if puffed up by some minor accomplishment that's nothing your cousin could do better at the end of the two boys' ninth and final year of compulsory education jianjun stayed home to work the fields but delong was admitted to the new suizhou foreign language school the tuition would be higher than at the public high school in xihe and delong would have to pay bus fare to ride the ten kilometers each way to suizhou but nai nai was elated at delong's achievement—in her guarded understated way—and sat in her chair like a sorceress waving the ink brush tipped with his own hair like a wand to cover the extra costs his father took work at the brick kiln up the road toward xihe with jianjun to help in the fields full-time now they would still bring in enough crops at dinner if he wasn't too exhausted from work baba would ask delong the english names for various things usually agricultural in nature rice corn cotton wheat retiring to his bedroom to study delong would hear baba repeating a word under his breath corn corn corn never quite able to get the hard r sound the summer delong graduated high school and sat for the college entrance examinations nai nai died happily not only was he accepted to wuhan polytechnic college to study english and tourism he also received a scholarship his father would still have to work at the brick kiln of course but the scholarship would offset some of the costs
when the incoming students were sorted into classes by major and aptitude delong was put in the et2 class the second-ranking cohort of english  tourism majors and was named class monitor on the strength of his high marks in mao zedong thought and deng xiaoping theory not quite the cream of the crop but not bad for a boy from the countryside wuhan was overwhelmingly large at first but delong kept close to the campus and focused on his studies and soon he felt at home he usually rose early and stood beside a pond on the school campus reciting new vocabulary words and sentences are your accommodations satisfactory and sometimes he stayed up late studying by candlelight when the dorm's fluorescent bulbs went out at the midnight curfew generally he was well-liked by his peers and this year he was elected secretary of the crazy english club his only irritation at wpc was a boy named tang li a bully who slept through class and stabbed delong with insults like soil bun or village idiot one day early in their first year when delong was making the morning announcements to his et2 classmates he had unconsciously slipped into the sibilant elisions of his native dialect bumpkin sounds like he's breaking wind tang li had laughed 
as with making the daily announcements delong's chief duties as monitor were mostly mundane scheduling class meetings reporting problems or suspicious activity generally serving as a liaison between administration and students this is how he had come into contact with mr hu the school's foreign affairs officer whose job it was to manage the foreign experts in a meeting with delong and the monitors from other classes mr hu suggested that the foreign experts might like to travel during the holiday to visit students' homes and learn about local chinese culture the monitors could help the school fulfill a duty of showing hospitality to their foreign guests this was hard for delong to fathom what could a foreigner possibly find interesting in xihe imagine an american or an australian exploring his sleepy little farming village the thought was comic and yet delong was intrigued by the new foreign teacher from the us frank laoshi he seemed kind and humorous he taught the students american slang and jokes and popular songs but no it would cost money to make provisions for a guest especially a foreigner better to let others make the invitations—monitors from other classes with families who had money and hometowns that had culture on the other hand    if his classmates knew frank laoshi were visiting his house wouldn't that command their respect delong might even be the object of their envy he would be—what was the expression frank laoshi had taught them—cool plus if frank laoshi chose to visit delong's village that turtle's egg tang li would have to tame his spiteful tongue that settled it
thus delong had found himself leading frank laoshi through the wuhan train station a dingy cavernous depot swarming with masses of holiday travelers pulling suitcases and migrant workers hauling their clothes in huge empty rice bags he found himself clutching frank laoshi's hand to make sure he wasn't herded onto the wrong train he found himself standing in the aisle of the train car so his teacher could cram his body into a seat between two wide-eyed curious peasants slurping noodles and when they arrived in suizhou four hours later he found himself feeling both proud and strangely nervous as he introduced frank laoshi to his father who had come to the station to meet them the men shook hands rather stiffly like two businessmen settling a contract neither felt quite sure about 
delong's father led them out of the suizhou station past a row of taxis to where a throng of people were filing onto a bus the station lay on the outskirts of the city this bus would take them to downtown suizhou where they would catch another to xihe it was an easy walk from there to the village delong's father carried frank laoshi's small suitcase in one hand and clutched the money for their bus fares in the other 
daniel frank laoshi said lagging behind all right if we take a taxi he jerked his thumb at a driver lazing on the hood of his car
delong called to his baba who had gone on ahead of them he explained his teacher's request his father had not factored the cost of a taxi ride the two of them whispered for a while finally determining that between them they had enough cash on hand frank laoshi looked relieved when they finally climbed into the taxi and pulled away 
delong's father sat in the passenger seat delong rode in back looking for landmarks to point out to frank laoshi along the way delong's old school the brick kiln there wasn't much to see when the taxi stopped in front of their house on the dirt lane twilight was settling over the village a cluster of clouds in the distance their undersides lit by the waning sun 
here frank laoshi said shifting onto his hip and digging a hand into his pocket let me pay
no no frank laoshi delong's mother and uncle and aunt and cousin walked into the lane to greet them neighbors were coming from their courtyards children from their play at the edge of the fields like moths drawn to flame only the chickens in the lane paid no mind it was polite of frank laoshi to offer of course but what kind of hosts would allow their guest to pay it's not necessary
no really frank laoshi said i don't mind
please allow me said delong people were watching them he held out some bills for his father to hand to the taxi driver here baba
but frank laoshi had already paid and opened his door
hi everybody frank laoshi said he began shaking hands hello hello hello
delong piled out of the taxi with his duffel bag and frank laoshi's suitcase despite his embarrassment about the money it was good to be home he turned in a circle to get a look at the place see if anything had changed the corn had come in and been harvested then the fields burned of the residue an unfamiliar dog lurked outside the courtyard between his father's house and his uncle's not much else it was quiet a welcome respite from the noise of wuhan suizhou even xihe with its honking cars and construction noise the air smelled clean a mild breeze tickled delong's bare forearms the western sky was streaked with orange and purple the distant clouds glowed pink

on its fall from frank laoshi's chopsticks the wayward piece of hongshao rou clipped the edge of the table glanced off the front of his borrowed undersized coat then skidded down the leg of his khakis a trail of oily brown stains marked its descent delong didn't think frank laoshi had dropped the meat deliberately but his father's grunt said he was not so sure his fingers were still doing their dance delong's uncle and cousin just laughed and frank laoshi sheepishly joined them 
 you can use your spoon delong said it will be easier he zipped up his puffy blue coat it had been chilly since morning but with the sun down now the temperature in the house was falling rapidly frank laoshi lay his chopsticks on the table and picked up the flat-bottomed soup spoon the muscles in his jaw flexed as though he were gritting his teeth resigned perhaps to the inevitable 
like a child said delong's father commenting on—what frank laoshi's difficulty with chopsticks or his distaste for hongshao rou was it amazement or disgust in his voice
clutching the spoon tightly in his fist frank laoshi scooped up a hunk of pork tossed it into his mouth and swallowed quickly almost without chewing he washed it down with a swig of hot tea
what are you doing here delong's father suddenly shouted 
delong's shock at the question only subsided when he saw frank laoshi turn and look over his shoulder following his father's eyes guo a filthy old peasant who lived down the lane stood hunched in the open doorway his lazy eye roving while he trained his good eye on frank laoshi
haven't you seen the foreigner already delong's father said
not up close said guo just from the fields
who's that frank laoshi asked
well now you've seen him up close get the hell out of here
just a peasant delong said
guo drifted out into the courtyard where he remained watching with slack-jawed fascination
delong refilled frank laoshi's small white porcelain cup from the teapot then refilled his uncle's his father's jianjun's and his own the little green leaves in his cup swirled to the surface 
now only one piece of hongshao rou was left in frank laoshi's bowl the teacher blew on his tea from which a thin wisp of steam rose he glanced up and his eyes met mr zhang's he scooped up the meat and lifted the spoon to his lips he chewed a couple of times and lurched forward a little delong looked at his father whose fingers had finally stopped curling frank laoshi swallowed hard and gulped down his tea 
take care frank laoshi said delong the tea is hot 
frank laoshi's eyes were watering he smiled weakly at mr zhang delicious thank you
delong knew it was a lie and guessed his father would see through it too but he translated anyway my father says there is plenty of meat help yourself
frank laoshi thanked them but said he wanted to try a little of everything by now the middle of the table was crowded with dishes of homestyle tofu bok choy cooked in oil and garlic fish and bony pieces of chicken covered in a dark sauce
ah delong's father suddenly gasped as though awakened from a reverie baijiu 
he leapt up from his seat and scurried to the kitchen he returned carrying five small glasses and a bottle of stiff grain alcohol which he had bought to share with his guest he handed out the glasses then filled them carefully starting with frank laoshi's glass delong's father held his glass aloft and said cheers—one of the few english words he knew frank laoshi raised his glass and mr zhang clinked his own against it then delong and his uncle and cousin joined in everyone clinking glasses with the person to his right and his left and across from him until every possible clinking partnership had been consummated delong was careful to show proper respect lowering the rim of his glass below that of the others' even jianjun's 
ganbei his father shouted and he drained his glass 
ganbei shouted delong's uncle and cousin they slammed their empty glasses on the table
frank laoshi sniffed his glass and pulled it sharply away whoo he said for a moment delong waited nervously watching for his father's reaction but then frank laoshi shouted ganbei he squinched his eyes together as the liquor went down then he coughed and smiled the others chuckled even filthy old guo laughing from the courtyard
ganbei delong said he held his glass to his mouth and for a moment before drinking it allowed the contrasting sensations to register the smooth solid coldness of the glass against his lips the harsh alcoholic vapors singeing his nostrils then he tipped back his head and the burn was in his throat then in his belly
the rest of the meal passed in peace delong's father refilled the glasses and they drank till the bottle was empty his father's fingers no longer danced and frank laoshi ate silently things even felt pleasant when delong's mother brought the soup and rice at the end the soup warmed him

delong had risen early that morning and put on his long underwear then jeans and a sweater and his zippered blue coat the distant clouds of the evening before had rolled through in the night dampening the ground outside and charging the air with a moist crispness when he paused outside the door to nai nai's old room he heard frank laoshi snoring lightly downstairs delong ate a bowl of noodles and followed his mother and father outside   
the family's acreage shared among delong's father and uncle was divided into ten sections in the corner plot nearest the houses beneath a thin misty fog the blackened stumps of cornstalks rose from the ground like rows of jagged rotted teeth straw had been spread between the rows and here and there young blades of grass sprouted from beneath it in other spots where wind had blown the straw aside the earth showed the scorch marks it bore the burning helped enrich the soil and prevent the spread of disease and pests and delong always thought it gave the fields a clean manicured look around the perimeter of this flame-scoured field cotton grew or had grown the leaves hung brown and brittle and the fibers showed white in the bolls waiting to be picked a couple of the family's plots lay fallow in another was a small garden of greens and cabbages presided over by a lopsided scarecrow—two bamboo cross-poles wearing a tattered brown shirt but most of the tracts were just like this one scorched and dusty-looking in spite of the night's rain furrowed every five meters by irrigation ditches bordered by ripe cotton ready to be tilled for the winter wheat crop
it couldn't be much past six o'clock but jianjun already stood on the far side of the corner plot leaning on the handle of a rotary tiller talking to his father and gesturing to the various plots of land jianjun's shoulders were broad his face weathered by sun and wind into a rugged reddish veneer from this distance delong couldn't help thinking his cousin appeared several years older than he was—he seemed confident capable one hand on the tiller as if it were a natural extension of his arm he didn't look like the dunce delong always remembered
jianjun had often cut class when they were in middle school one day when delong was excused to go to the restroom he found jianjun standing in the stall with his legs spread stroking his elephant's trunk and breathing in quick shallow gasps jianjun didn't seem to be bothered by the intrusion—finished was all he said before rinsing his hands under the spigot outside—but delong was mortified did anyone else know what his stupid cousin had been doing right there in the school loo was this what jianjun always did when he cut class what if someone else had walked in the incident confirmed for delong what he'd long suspected jianjun was all body and no mind
but now standing by the tiller in the early morning light there was that keenness to jianjun's face that delong had not noticed before delong suddenly felt small as though he had remained a child while his cousin matured into an adult jianjun jerked the tiller's pull-cord and the engine coughed spewed a black cloud of smoke into the air then rumbled to life jianjun guided the tiller by its long blue handles along the edge of the field then turned and began another pass in the opposite direction the tiller's blades sank into the ground and churned up the loose dark soil from a distance it looked like an earthy thread unspooling behind jianjun as he walked 
meanwhile delong's baba set out for the brick kiln along with uncle who sometimes worked there when he wasn't needed in the fields—more and more in the last year or so now that jianjun had the hang of things delong was to spend the morning helping his mother and aunt pick cotton an hour later he was halfway down a row on one side of the plot his sack still less than half-filled with cotton bolls when the noise of the tiller stopped and jianjun called out to him
come plow a couple rows he said and delong couldn't help but think of the way tang li had ridiculed their dialect jianjun stalked across the field in a pair of rubber boots i need to take a shit
delong set down his sack of cotton and walked over to the where the tiller sat poised for its next pass down the length of the field delong had never actually driven it before though he'd watched his father many times it had fat tires and two long skinny handles like the antennae of some huge blue insect and a two-stroke diesel engine below which the three-tined steel blades were mounted on a drive shaft he knew how it all worked the pull-cord that cranked the motor the two levers one to engage the blades another to switch gears forward neutral reverse the throttle control positioned at his right thumb when he gripped the handles simple enough delong took hold of the pull-cord and tugged the machine just wheezed he pulled again harder a click-click-clicking sound then a wheeze three more tries the same result each time abruptly he became aware of how foolish and weak he must look the thing had cranked right up for jianjun delong looked around—his mother and aunt were too busy picking cotton to notice him neighbors in their fields too were preoccupied with their own toil delong tried once more pulling the cord as hard as he could with both hands a cough a belch of greasy diesel exhaust that made his stomach turn and finally the engine's sputtering rumble 
delong positioned himself behind the tiller and grasped the handles the engine's vibrations ran up his arms before him stretched a line of burned cut cornstalks looking less like rotten teeth now than miniature black fenceposts a meter to his right was the shallow gully of an irrigation ditch on his left was the fecund upturned earth jianjun had already tilled a soft brown lake of soil that smelled to delong once the engine's burst of noxious smoke dissipated like baba delong raised the handles to lift the blades off the ground then pulled the lever to engage them the tiller screeched and the drive shaft began to rotate the three blades so far so good delong pressed the throttle with his thumb it offered less resistance than he expected and the engine revved its low-pitched rumble rising to an operatic whine an effect that startled delong into dropping the handles completely the blades sinking into the ground as they lowered but the tiller was still in neutral and the tines just churned up the same bit of earth again and again until delong grasped the handles and lifted them clear of the ground again he shoved the gearshift into the forward position then tried as he'd seen jianjun do to lower the blades slowly and simultaneously to ease—eeeease—his thumb onto the throttle but the tiller whined again and lurched forward its tines skidding across the top of the unbroken ground as it pulled delong behind it he finally released the throttle managing this time to retain his grip on the handles 
delong cursed the ornery machine there was no eeeeasing onto this damned throttle at least not for his untrained thumb—it seemed drawn to the little black lever like a piece of metal drawn to a strong magnet delong disengaged the blades and shifted into neutral so he could practice after several attempts he was able to feather the sensitive throttle from that bumbida-bumbida rumble up to the high-pitched diggity-diggity whine gradually as though progressing through a musical scale on the piano pleased with this refinement of his skill he reversed for two or three meters to where he'd begun aligned the wheels then shifted into forward now he was ready lower and ease lower and ease he eeeeased onto the throttle and dipped the spinning tines down to the ground which broke beneath them and turned a rich brown mottled with fragments of cornstalks and straw miraculously the tiller crawled forward he was doing it 
delong walked behind the machine at an even leisurely pace feeling the softened earth beneath his shoes there was something soothing about this like the feeling he got when he rolled a new vocabulary word around in his mouth a few times until the foreignness of it finally felt familiar accommodations accommodations accommodations satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory but the tiller was gradually drifting leftward and when the left wheel fell from solid ground to fresh-plowed soil the whole thing listed at an angle and swerved into the area jianjun had already tilled the machine was front-heavy and difficult to turn in this soil which delong now realized was more moist than its surface appeared his feet were growing heavy with mud his shoes slipping grappling with the long handles he overcorrected the machine's course and before he knew it he was plowing cornstalks under again but well off his original line veering to the right now then back left nearly back into the mud then to the right once more and in his frustration and panic the throttle again became a heavy magnet to delong's thumb and the tiller wove a crooked path as though driven by a drunk man or as though delong were driving not a tiller but an obstinate donkey or as though a drunk man were driving an obstinate donkey until the right tire was suddenly lower than the left—slipping sliding down the irrigation ditch—and it seemed the weight of the engine might turn the whole machine onto its side
then a second miracle happened a firm hand appeared around delong's wrist and pulled it from the handle and just as quickly as delong had begun the tiller's slide into the ditch jianjun had stopped it
what the hell jianjun had turned off the engine after steering the tiller back onto level ground his ruddy face was twisted with scorn
delong surveyed his handiwork if jianjun had tilled a lake of soil then he had made a river its jagged course flowing away from the larger body leaving a peninsula of untilled earth between them 
but jianjun didn't wait for delong to answer over there he said jerking his chin back toward the houses your foreigner's awake
and there standing in the lane that divided the fields from the house stood frank laoshi in khakis and a long-sleeved shirt arms crossed hugging himself against the cold

after dinner the five men moved to the living room and watched an english premier league football match on the nineteen-inch tv by that time baba and uncle were drunk on baijiu cheeks flushed speech slurred in their state of intoxication they took to cursing the local party leaders as blood-sucking leeches power-mongers who went about declaring new taxes and fees at whim agricultural tax school repair fee irrigation tax they took turns listing them as though it were a game hygiene fee road tax market management fee village tax what the hell was a village tax uncle wanted to know
these were familiar complaints but they pricked delong's conscience nonetheless his parents could scarcely afford to pay for his education much less to host frank laoshi that morning when delong had left jianjun with the tiller and crossed the field in his muddy shoes he saw that his teacher was shivering he had brought frank laoshi inside and lent him a sweater to put on
as he donned the sweater delong asked him are your accommodations satisfactory frank laoshi was the first person to sleep in nai nai's room since she died 
oh sure he said the mattress was much firmer than he was used to of course i was fine once i fell asleep he added just took me a long while to get there he was still shivering even with the sweater 
it will be warmer outside delong said in the sunshine they sat in the courtyard and watched jianjun plow the field delong remembered when his father had spread concrete over the courtyard's surface smoothing it with a trowel most homes in the village had a dirt courtyard if they had a courtyard at all and the concrete was a sign of his parents' relative prosperity relative delong thought—a family member a comparison to something else—one of those words with strangely various meanings english was full of such quirks like the difference between satisfactory and factory though the words had to be related somehow
when baba arrived home for his lunch break he gave frank laoshi his coat to wear a brown suit coat worn thin at the elbows the shoulders dusted with soot from the brick kiln frank laoshi tried to refuse but delong's father insisted by that time jianjun had finished tilling the corner plot and moved on to the next one delong's mother set down her sack bulging with cotton and came in to prepare lunch but his aunt stayed out and began sowing wheat in the newly plowed field she walked the length of the field with a basin of grain on her hip casting handfuls of seed onto the overturned soil frank laoshi suddenly rushed back into the house as though he'd forgotten some important thing he had to do when he returned he had a camera he stood in the lane and photographed delong's aunt as she walked the field
baba wondered aloud at frank laoshi's fascination with this mundane activity delong did not respond but he had been thinking the same thing
what is she planting frank laoshi asked the viewfinder still raised to his eye
delong told him then baba asked delong to translate baba said dui—right—then echoing delong's english wheat and his eyes followed his brother's wife in her white sun hat and rubber boots the arc of her arm the dots of grain flung into the air trying to see whatever was there to see
now frank laoshi sat next to baba and uncle on the wooden couch watching the football match sipping a cup of hot tea while the chinese men drank lukewarm beer untouched slices of cantaloupe sat before them on a low table
grain fee uncle said
second irrigation tax baba answered in his voice the air of a trump card being played 
jianjun and delong sat on stools at frank laoshi's end of the couch on the tv screen delong's favorite team was on the pitch watching the players glide around the field in their blue and white jerseys was a welcome distraction a reason not to talk 
but jianjun—somehow sober though he had drunk more baijiu than any of them—had something to say and he leaned toward delong and spoke with a hushed voice confidentially asking if delong remembered a certain girl from the village with whom they had attended middle school delong did but jianjun didn't even wait for him to answer sometimes she lets me    he said with a leering grin you know delong said nothing and jianjun seemed to take the silence as approval or envy i'm going to marry her next year he said
uncle had finished his beer and was sleepy it was time to go home he said and jianjun followed
delong's team was down two goals he left frank laoshi and his father to watch the rest of the game in silence he had seen his mother moving in the hallway and went to help her in her arms she carried a thick cotton quilt the kind that could be spread over you to keep you warm when you slept or as a layer of padding underneath you the one his mother carried had a bright floral pattern delong knew it came from the bed she and his father shared in the back bedroom
bring the quilt from your bed too she said to delong 
he did as he was told and brought the quilt into nai nai's old bedroom where his mother had spread her flowered beizi on top of the yellow one already on the bed delong and his mother folded his quilt and laid it across the foot of the bed tonight frank laoshi would have one beizi for extra padding beneath him and another for warmth above him the third he could use if he was still cold 
another wave of regret swept over delong other students could have kept frank laoshi comfortable without sacrificing so much of their own comfort or that of their family delong wanted to say this to his mother he knew he had caused her hardship and he knew frank laoshi would not be comfortable there no matter what they did but he also knew that bringing the matter up would only make it worse she would be insulted by his embarrassment 
mama pulled four blankets—three of their own and one borrowed from auntie—from a closet and gave two to delong the football match on the television ended and everyone began migrating to their respective bedrooms frank laoshi told them all goodnight and shut his door baba gave a shake of his head and padded away
delong squeezed his mother's arm said goodnight and turned out the light in his room he curled up under the two blankets still wearing his puffy blue coat and he clenched his teeth to keep them from chattering he pictured his parents huddled together for warmth under their two blankets and their bodies seemed strange to him delong thought of frank laoshi stretched between the quilts in nai nai's old bed and something inside him turned cold
